# LiDAR_Camera_Fusion

In this Project I practiced some most advanced skills that Self Driving Car Engineers use to fuse LiDARs with Cameras.
LiDAR is used more and more in almost every robotics startup, and mixing it with a camera is really cool!

## Three Most Important things about Sensor Fusion
In this Project, I have built my understanding around three most important things about Sensor Fusion:
1. Sensors and Sensor Fusion
2. Early Fusion
3. Late Fusion

## Sensors and  Sensor Fusion
In this project project my focus is on Cameras and LiDARs (IMAGES and POINT CLOUDS), which are being used by almost every Autonomous Vehicle Company.

### Cameras:
Today, Cameras are very scalable and integrated in every Self Driving Car.

In above Picture, which is adopted from [here](https://electrek.co/2016/10/20/tesla-new-autopilot-hardware-suite-camera-nvidia-tesla-vision/), it's the Tesla's Self Driving Vehicle Model. And notice that we have 3 cameras, on in left, on in right and one in center, side cameras are generally called stereo pairs which makes it easy to estimate disance to an obstacle.
