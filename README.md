# LiDAR_Camera_Fusion

In this Project I practiced some most advanced skills that Self Driving Car Engineers use to fuse LiDARs with Cameras.
LiDAR is used more and more in our daily lives, and mixing it with a camera is really cool!

## Three Most Important things about Sensor Fusion
In this Project, I have built my understanding around three most important things about Sensor Fusion:
1. About Sensors and Sensor Fusion
2. Early Fusion
3. Late Fusion

## Sensors and  Sensor Fusion
In this project project my focus is on Camera and LiDARs (IMAGES and POINT CLOUDS), which are being used by almost every Autonomous Vehicle Company.

### Cameras:
Today, Cameras are very scalable and integrated in every Self Driving Car.
